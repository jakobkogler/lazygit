{"description": "In this test we attempt to create a commit with the commit message `first commit`, but a pre-commit hook fails (the hook checks for the existance of a file called `disruptive`). Afterwards we make the pre-commit hook work (by discarding the file), and again attempt to create a commit. This time the commit message should already be remembered from the failed attempt and be prefilled. Then another commit is made with the message `second commit`, and this time the last commit message no longer prefilled.", "speed": 20}
