{ "description": "In this test we attempt to create a commit with the commit message `test`, but a pre-commit hook fails (the hook checks for the existance of a file called `disruptive`). Afterwards we make the pre-commit hook work (by discarding the file), and again attempt to create a commit. This time the commit message should already be remembered from the failed attempt and be prefilled.", "speed": 20 }
